Advances 21-Jan-2020
--------------------


* **Version**: v0.3
* **Responsible**: FOE, BGP

Summary of changes:

* **Commit executed** : "Anisotropic diffusion filter" with the following description:

  * Added anisotropic diffusion filter
  * Better integration of the stitch and flattening operations with
    the segmentation. These operations are now also applied to the
    segmentation.
  * Class RetinalLayers now encodes fluid as a new layer.
  * Layers colors can be configured in configuration Files.
  * Perfilometer axis now correctly resizes with main scan axis.
  * Detection of the background mask now working properly.



* Bug fixing. Several classes of the `data` package were having
   issues of cyclic importing octant. In particular, import line:

  .. code-block:: Python

     import octant.data as octant

   was causing error:

   .. code-block:: Python

      AttributeError: module 'octant' has no attribute 'data'

   It has now been updated to:

   .. code-block:: Python

      from octant import data as octant

   The following files were affected:

     * `data.Document.py`
     * `data.OCTscanSegmentation.py`
     * `data.OCTvolume.py`
     * `data.OCTvolumeSegmentation.py`

Documentation

  * The log of progress for 2020 was initiated. Files affected include
    `logOfProgress_2020` and `logOfProgress`.
  * Revision date of `logOfProgress_2019` corrected
