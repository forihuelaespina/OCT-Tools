10,C,0,,11-Aug-19,0,0.5,,FOE,OpenCV dependency,Attend dependency on OpenCV (remove dependency on panorama for stitching?)
11,C,0,,11-Aug-19,0,0.5,,FOE,Mosaicing / Stitching,"Panorama Stitching operation works only 2 images at a time. One may still join as many images as desired, but it will have to be done in pairs. For instance, if 3 images have to be stitched; you will have to make first 2, and then to the  result add the 3rd. Although this works, but it is not a desirable situation. Note however that this is not a bug but a limitation of panorama itself. See  summary section Adrian Rosebrock's (creator of python's panorama code) article:
  https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/11/opencv-panorama-stitching/
Ideally, we want to select all files at once and ""solve"" the whole mosaic in one go."
