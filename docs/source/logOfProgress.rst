About the log
-------------


This file attempts to gather all the reporting of progress that until
17-Dec-2018 was occurring through e-mails sent to Rodrigo Matsui. After that
date, we more or less succeeded in maintain this log up-to-date. Please, note
however, that this account does not cover the very first part of the project,
and that we may have missed some of the e-mails in the chain. This is
a bit more wordly and descriptive than updates to the GitHub.
