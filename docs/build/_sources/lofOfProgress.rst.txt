This file attempts to gather all the reporting of progress that has until now
(17-Dec-2018) been occurring through e-mails sent to Rodrigo Matsui. This is
a bit more wordly and descriptive than updates to the GitHub. Please, note
however, that this account does not cover the very first part of the project,
and that we may have missed some of the e-mails in the chain.



.. _secTaskForV0.3:

Tasks pending for v0.3
----------------------

* Reorganise classes in subpackages; IOT (main), data (for classes corresponding
to the data model), Op (for classes related to the operation), GUI (for classes
related to the user interface)
* Improve segmentation algorithm
* Attend dependency on OpenCV (remove dependency on panorama for stitching?)

Version   Date        Responsible Change Description
========= =========== =========== ===========================================
0.1beta   3/Aug/2018  FOE         *After some adjustements, the program now
                                  runs in my machine (under Windows) and still
                                  using the interpreter. For compilation, a few
                                  other issues have to be attended.
                                  NOTE: FOE is using *Pyzo* with *Miniconda*, whereas
                                  AACA uses *PyCharm* which gives some problems
                                  because uses some non-standard libraries.
                                  * We have dependencies on *Qt5* (for the
                                  interface), but also with *SciPy* (this is not
                                  too serious as it is a standard library of
                                  Python, yet it must be installed in the
                                  interpreter).
                                  * We have dependencies on *OpenCV* for the
                                  stitching operation which currently relies
                                  on external algorithm *Panorama*. While this
                                  is not ideal, but it works by now.
                                  * Hardcoded path in the perfilometer function
                                  has been removed.
                                  * Hardcoded paths in the mosaic function
                                  have been removed.
                                  * Some further debugging
========= =========== =========== ===========================================
0.1beta   31/Jul/2018 AACA/FOE    * Still unsolved the issue with hard paths.
========= =========== =========== ===========================================
0.1beta   17/Jul/2018 AACA        * Reported by Rodrigo that the program does
                                  not starts up. This was found to be due to
                                  some remaining hard "paths".
========= =========== =========== ===========================================
0.1beta   11/Jul/2018 AACA        * Uploaded first version of the program
                                  and report to OSF. This version still has
                                  severe integration issues.
